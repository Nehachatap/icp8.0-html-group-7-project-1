        <p>Nandini (Padmini Kolhapure) and Shekhar (Sachin Khedekar), who grew up in an orphanage, got married, and had four kids: Anju, Vijay, Ajay, and Soni. Vijay and Ajay are twins, but Vijay has trouble moving around. Shekhar drives a jeep, and Annie teaches violin. Despite some money problems, they're a happy family, except when Shekhar spends too much money at the local "toddy shop" because he sometimes drinks too much.

        A local toddy vendor Patangrao Kurhade (Nagesh Bhonsle) had an eye on Nandini. One day, he went to her house and tried to rape her. Shekhar came to know about that and has a fight with Patangrao, and things take a bad turn. Patangrao decides to get back at Shekhar. When he sees Ajay riding his bicycle, he hits him with his van. Ajay is hurt, and they find out he needs a blood transfusion. But there's a problem - Nandini can't donate her blood because she's sick. The doctors tell them Nandini has late-stage leukemia and only has a few months to live. This is a shock for the family.
        
        Shekhar tries to change his ways, but one day, during a fight with Patangrao, he gets killed. Nandini is devastated, but she decides to be strong for her family. She worries about what will happen to her kids after she's gone. She doesn't want them to end up in an orphanage like she and Shekhar did, labeled as orphans. So, she makes a tough decision - she will give her children up for adoption.

        <p>Dr. Raghav Shastri (Gashmeer Mahajani), Indian by origin, is NASA's youngest scientist. He returns to his motherland, only to find out that his country is full of God worshippers. However, Raghav is not one of them. He has been specially invited by the PM to work on a radio frequency project, which will strengthen the coastal security of the country. The people in-charge of his security, receive a tip-off from their sources that a terrorist group, led by Rashida and Hafiz, have arrived in Pune to kill Raghav Shastri and cripple India's coastal security project. Subsequently, they refuse to arrange his stay at a hotel, and relocate him to a posh society in Pune. He becomes agitated to find out a temple of Swami Samarth, a God whom his parents believed in a lot, within his society premises. Raghav, who has lied to his wife Radha and daughter Popo that his mother is dead, actually has an estranged relationship with her. For so many years, he has accused her of being responsible for the death of his father Damodar Shastri. Therefore, he decides to finish his project at the earliest and leave. In ISRO, he is warmly welcomed by his superior Dr. Vyas(Mohan Agashe). However, his rival Dr. Ballar (Sunil Abhyankar) who had previously failed in this project, is agitated at his inclusion in the group. Meanwhile, during a family outing of Raghav, Hafiz tries to kill him by bombing the mall. However, he forgets the bomb in the rickshaw itself, which is later confiscated by the Anti-Terrorism Squad, who begin a hunt for Hafiz and his teammates.Directed by:<i><b>Pravin Tarde,Pranit Kulkarni</b></i> </p>
